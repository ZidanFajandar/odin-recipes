        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy pasta dish made with fettuccine, grilled chicken, and a rich Alfredo sauce. It's a comforting and indulgent meal that's perfect for any occasion.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>8 ounces shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Add onion, mushrooms, and remaining garlic; sauté until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add milk and half-and-half; cook and stir until smooth and creamy. Stir in both cheeses until melted.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken mixture, tomatoes, and sour cream. Serve over cooked fettuccini.</li>
